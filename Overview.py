Welcome, students! In today's session, you're invited to engage with two unique AI-driven bots, **FunCE Bot A** and **FunCE Bot B**. 
Both bots have been trained on the 'Fundamentals of Chemical Engineering' course materials but differ in how they interact and present information. 
Your task is to interact with these bots, explore how they respond to your queries, and identify key differences in their approach and depth of explanations.
